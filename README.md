## Description

The purpose of this project was two fold, to reproduce the functionality of a social network, using Rails and CI, and to work in teams using Agile practices. 

### The Technical Challenge

The application was to mirror the functionality of the popular social media site, Facebook. The project was to be written in Ruby using the Rails framework.  and 
The applications involved in this development:
* Rails
* Devise
* Travis
* Heruko
* GitHub
* Materialize
* Rubocop Linter

#### [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
This is a framework for writing Ruby programs. Rails promotes the concept that models, views, and controllers should be kept separate by storing the code for each element as separate files in separate directories. Installing Rails sets up the directory structure and provides a number of modules that facilitate the Model View Controller model. `ActiveRecord` is the business logic and database communication. `ActionView` deals with the presentation of pages returned to the client. `ActionController` handles browser requests and communication between the model and the view. 

#### [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
This is a user authentication package. It provides all of the complex functionality of user login, validation and encription. Using this has enabled us to avoid `reinventing the wheel`.

#### [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
Travis is a `Continuous Integration` tool. Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

#### [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/)
Heruko is a cloud based repository that enables working applications be quickly deployed and enables agile project management. Working prototypes can be made available for client feedback and this facilitates the iterative development process.
